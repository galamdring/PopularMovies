# Popular Movies
This project is my solution to the first part of the Popular Movies project in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

I followed the design patterns we learned in [Sunshine](https://github.com/udacity/ud851-Sunshine) and some of the code may look similar as a result.

* Movies are displayed in the main layout as a grid of their movie posters.
* Spinner in main activity changes sort between most popular and highest rated
* Clicking on the poster opens the detail page, which includes the title, release date, average rating, and plot
* Only external library used is [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)


## Getting Started
In order to run this, you will need to get an APIKey from the Movie Database : www.tmdb.com

Add it to the strings file as apiKey
